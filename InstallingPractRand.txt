Note: I have only tried this on my Mac M2, but should also work for Linux

0. Download latest PractRand (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pracrand/files/)
1. Place it where most convenient
2. Open a terminal in that folder
3. Type (There will probably be some warnings):
  g++ -std=c++14 -c src/*.cpp src/RNGs/*.cpp src/RNGs/other/*.cpp -O3 -Iinclude -pthread
  ar rcs libPractRand.a *.o
  rm *.o
  g++ -std=c++14 -o PractRandTest tools/RNG_test.cpp libPractRand.a -O3 -Iinclude -pthread
4. Add the folder to PATH

If you have dificulties, do post an issue
