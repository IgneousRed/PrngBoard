A low score doesn not prove PRNG is not random.
  Even true random can output all 0s.
A high score does not prove PRNG is random.
  It might have been lucky, tho very unlikely.
Always make sure you are piping the right data.
  If you are piping 32bits as 64bits it will fail immediately,
    however some popular RNGs are indeed bad.
    I once made a mistake of sending the buffer address repeatedly,
      instead of the data in it... Was quite confused for several hours.
  It is more of a concern piping 64bits as 32bits for example,
    as you may get a better outcome without knowing it.
  Be VERY carefull when making and testing non-power-of-2 RNGs, even more so with non-byte ones.

2 multicore tests at a time on my Mac:
  required Real time is around 149.73h (6.23875 days)
  required CPU time is around 419h
